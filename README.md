# Amazon_Bot
This is a Bot for checking and buying a Product on Amazon

### Windows only! 
### Be careful, this buys everything in your Cart!

## Install: (All Installers are in the Git Repository)
* Run "requirements.ps1" from the Installer/Requirements folder in Powershell
* Run the installer (setup.exe) from Installers/Setup Files folder. (Your Anti-Virus might give you a warning as the installer isn't signed)

## Google Chrome and .Net please open your Google Chrome Webbrowser and open the amazon website
* Open your chrome browser and make sure in the to right corner (under profiles) it says guest or not signed in.
* Now **_log into the website_** and make sure you click the stay signed in options.
* Change your Amazon language to german or english or complex products will not work!

## Run Bot:
* Run "Amazon_Bot" Program from the path you specified.(Also Desktop or Start Menu)

## Now the Bot should be running!
* Click on Run checking and buying.
* The Bot should open your Chrome Browser. After Chrome was started, make sure it says you are logged in on Amazon! (If not, Login)
* The Bot will now continuously refresh the page and check if the Product is Available.

## Checking a Product:
* When checking and buying a product for the first time, it takes about one minute to create a chromeprofile for that item. Don't close the program while creating it and wait until the chrome windows open! Otherwise you have to open the programs installation folder and delete the folder after the product you wanted to check for or delete and re-add the product!

## When it is available, it will automaticly add the Product to your cart and go to the checkout. 
If you have never bought anything using chrome:
* All you have to do now is entering your Amazon password on the Chrome/Amazon website and pressing enter!

Else:
* The Bot should have bought the product for you now.

## Settings:
* Settings can be changed on the fly. (including product editting)
* Enter your preferred delay in the textbox at the bottom.
* Click Edit Products to add and remove products.

## Edit Products
* When adding new Products, make sure the Product name is exactly what it says on Amazon (eg: PS5, PS5 - Digital Edition) or complex products won't work.
* If you want to check for a product make sure you enabled the checkbox!
* You can also enter a wishlist url to buy everything that is in that wishlist (wishlist has to a wishlist of your Account).
* Buying multiple quantity of a product doesn't work properly with wishlists! (leave it at 1 for wishlists!)

## Notes:
* When starting the Bot all Chrome Drivers and Chrome Browser Windows will be closed!
* When closing the Bot all Chrome Drivers and Chrome Browser Windows will be closed!

### If you encounter any problems feel free to ask for help in our Discord.

### I recommend not letting the bot run on standalone and keeping on eye on it.
